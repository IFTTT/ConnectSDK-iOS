For example, include this token to get the enabled status of Connections for your user. It is also the same token that is used to make trigger, query, and action requests for Connections on behave of the user. You should get this token from a communication between your servers and ours using your `IFTTT-Service-Key`. Never include this key in your app binary, rather create on endpoint on your own server to access the user's IFTTT service token.
